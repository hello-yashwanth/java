//constructor is a block of code
//constructor will be calling by creating a object
//when we allogate objects then we have a memory in variables and methods . so constructors are used to set various operations in objects
// it will use when operations are used in methods and variables 
//when we didn't create constructor java will automatically create constructor so this is known as default constructotr or implict constructor
//it has no return type.default constructor is always public
